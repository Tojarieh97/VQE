For the VQE we implemented six hamitonians:
LIH for 4 qubits
Transverse Ising Model for 2 qubits
Transverse Ising Model for 3 qubits
Transverse Ising Model for 4 qubits
H2 for 2 qubits
H2 for 4 qubits


For the SSVQE in all its forms we used:
LIH 
H2
Transverse Ising Model (same one as generated for VQE)
for 4 qubits

Molecular Hamiltonians were generated using OpenFermion while running on Google Colab.

Transverse Ising Model was generated by functions we created.
